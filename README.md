# Implementation of query recovery attacks

This repo contains implementation of several query recovery attacks on conjunctive/boolean queries addressed in:
"Efficient Query Recovery Attack on Boolean Queries"

The code is generally based on the implementation of CKWS-attack by Dijkslag et al., available at https://github.com/marcowindt/passive-ckws-attack.

# Issues

The repo is currently undergoing modifications (25.11.4.).

The code does not run in generic settings but only runs on certain python library/GPU driver versions.
The current requirements.txt file does not contain the right versions.
